## CUDA 
is a parallel computing platform and programming model that uses graphics processing units (GPUs) to speed up applications. CUDA allows to dramatically speed up computing applications.

### How CUDA works: 
Use CUDA to write functions called CUDA kernels that run on GPUs.
The CPU copies data from the main RAM to the GPU's memory.
The CPU tells the GPU to execute the CUDA kernel in parallel.
The GPU executes the code in a block that organizes threads into a grid.
The GPU copies the final result back to the main memory.
